Hi, 
thank you for taking a look at my GitHub profile. My name is Samuel Lanco≈° and I am a passionate developer who literally found himself in IT.
I have spent almost half a year improving my programming skills and I would like to guide you through my progress in programming:

Project No.1 - these are my beginnings of programming in Java, where I got to know the basic functions (for senior developers it may seem funny :-)), which I then transferred to the next project.

Project No.2 - knowledge from the first project was transformed into a full-fledged terminal application. 
The goal was to automate the process of generating work tasks based on priority, where the user received the most current task, with the possibility of solving them.
The solution options differed depending on the type of work task, and there is also the possibility to attach other tasks from the .csv file and continue working.
This application is able to overwrite files, which means that when you turn it on again, you continue where you left off.
I have to admit that I learned a lot during this project and it gave me a kick to continue my education.

Project No.3 - I am currently working on expanding project number 2 by converting it into a web application using REST API. The application is developed using the Spring / SpringBoot framework and will run on localhost (Tomcat server).
Work tasks will be stored in the MySQL database (JDBC), and workers (managers/employees) will receive the most current task intended for them.
Project number 3 is still being worked on. 

If you would like to ask me some questions or help with my project, here is my email: samuellancos@gmail.com
Thank you very much :-)
